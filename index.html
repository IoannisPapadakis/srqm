        <p>This repository contains the teaching material for the <a href="http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/">Statistical Reasoning and Quantitative Methods</a> (SRQM) course run at Sciences Po by François Briatte and Ivaylo Petev. The course requires Internet access and a working copy of <a href="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>.</p>

<p>In the setup instructions below, the <code>SRQM</code> folder is the folder that you download from this webpage in compressed format. Move it to a stable and easily accessible location on your hard drive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you later move the <code>SRQM</code> folder by changing its name or the names of the folders that lead to it on your hard drive, you will have to run the next installation steps again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 1: open Stata</h2>

<p>Open Stata:</p>

<h3>Windows users:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the <em>entire Stata application folder</em> is installed in the <code>Program Files</code> folder (sometimes renamed in your language). The application needs to run from its folder to work.</li>
<li>On Windows Vista, 7 or above, open Stata by right-clicking the program icon and selecting 'Run as administrator' for this setup procedure to complete.</li>
<li>You might see two versions of Stata on your system, one of which works only on 64-bit computers: use whichever works with your system.</li>
</ul><h3>Mac OS X users:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the <em>entire Stata application folder</em> is installed in the <code>Applications</code> folder. The application needs to run from its folder to work.</li>
<li>If you are using Mac OS X Gatekeeper settings, allow applications downloaded from anywhere to run in the 'Security &amp; Privacy' panel of your System Preferences (accessible from the Apple menu).</li>
</ul><h2>Step 2: set the working directory</h2>

<p>Use the 'File : Change Working Directory…' menu to set the <code>SRQM</code> folder as the working directory. The menu is also accessible with ⌘⇧J (Cmd-Shift-J) on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The folder path that appears in the Results window might look like the following examples:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th align="left">System</th>
<th align="left">Example of a folder path</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Mac OS X</td>
<td align="left"><code>/Users/fr/Documents/Teaching/SRQM</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Windows</td>
<td align="left"><code>C:\Users\Ivo\Desktop\SRQM</code></td>
</tr>
</table><p>This path is where the course setup will tell Stata to look for the SRQM teaching material. This folder path must stay intact throughout the semester for Stata to access the course material.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you inadvertently modify the path to your <code>SRQM</code> folder by moving or renaming it, you will get an error message and will have to run through these installation steps again. Be careful!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 3: run the setup</h2>

<p>Make sure that you are connected to the Internet, then, type the following line in the Command window and press <code>Enter</code> to execute (run) the course setup:</p>

<pre><code>run profile
</code></pre>

<p>The setup will take a few minutes to complete. It will allow you to download additional teaching material during the semester with the <code>srqm fetch</code> command.</p>

<h2>Uninstalling</h2>

<p>At the end of the semester, type <code>srqm clean folder</code> to stop redirecting Stata to the <code>SRQM</code> folder as your working directory.</p>
